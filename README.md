## Project description & context - Sunniez eCommerce Website

Write a description of what your website is selling and what it does. This is so someone else who is coding your website can understand what it is about.
This particular project was to create a complete eCommerce website. A [pattern library] (http://localhost:4000/pattern-library/) was created to organize and separate the different areas of content individually, which can later be brought together in the main html file. Each page including the home page, product page, product detail page, as well as the final checkout page are to be coded. The Home page is the first page the user will see when they are brought to the website. The products page can be viewed by clicking on the "products" located within the top header. The product details can be viewed once a specific product has been clicked.
